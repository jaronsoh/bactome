class RandomSequence(object):
    '''!
    Class to generate random sequences based on input parameters. 
    Although the initial intention is to generate DNA/RNA sequences, 
    it can be used to generate other random sequences; such as, 
    amino acid sequences or even non-biological sequences.

    Basic example:

        >>> s = RandomSequence()
        >>> selection = {'A':25, 'U':25, 'G':25, 'C':25}
        >>> s.initiateNucleotide(selection)
        >>> s.generateSequence(50, True, True)
        'AGAUCCCCCGGACAGGUUAUGGAUAAGUGUCCACCUCUAACUAUUUCUGC'

    Example without start and stop:

        >>> s = RandomSequence()
        >>> selection = {'A':25, 'T':25, 'G':25, 'C':25}
        >>> s.initiateNucleotide(selection)
        >>> s.initiateStart('TTG,CTG,ATG')
        >>> s.initiateStop('TAA,TAG,TGA')
        >>> s.generateSequence(50, False, False)
